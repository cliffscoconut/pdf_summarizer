      "Apple Inc. Purchase Agreement Purchase Order Terms and Conditions This Purchase Agreement (the \"Agreement\") sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to all purchases of goods and services by Apple from Seller by means of a purchase order (a \"PO\") issued by Apple to Seller. As used in this Agreement, \"Seller\" means the entity identified on the face of a PO as \"Seller\" and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and \"Apple\" means Apple Inc. Seller and Apple hereby agree as follows: 1. SERVICES & DELIVERABLES. Seller agrees to perform the services (\"Services\") and/or provide the software (including all updates, revisions, error corrections, and subsequent versions thereof, \"Software\"), materials, equipment, hardware, goods, or deliverables described in a PO (collectively referred to as \"Goods\"), in accordance with the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the terms and conditions on the face of the PO, which terms are incorporated herein by reference. Upon acceptance of a PO, shipment of Goods or commencement of Services, Seller shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, whether Seller acknowledges or otherwise signs this Agreement or the PO, unless Seller objects to such terms in writing prior to shipping Goods or commencing Services. A PO does not constitute a firm offer and may be revoked at any time prior to acceptance. This Agreement may not be added to, modified, superseded, or otherwise altered, except by a writing signed by an authorized Apple representative. Any terms or conditions contained in any acknowledgment, invoice, or other communication of Seller which are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, are hereby rejected. To the extent that a PO might be treated as an acceptance of Seller's prior offer, such acceptance is expressly made on condition of assent by Seller to the terms hereof and shipment of the Goods or beginning performance of any Services by Seller shall constitute such assent. Apple hereby reserves the right to reschedule any delivery or cancel any PO issued at any time prior to shipment of the Goods or prior to commencement of any Services. Apple shall not be subject to any charges or other fees as a result of such cancellation. All shrink-wrap, click-wrap, browse-wrap, and similar terms accompanying any Software, and any online terms of use, terms of service, or similar terms relating to Services, are expressly rejected by Apple and are null and void. The terms of this Agreement shall prevail over all other such terms and conditions. 2. DELIVERY. Time is of the essence. Delivery of Goods shall be made pursuant to the schedule, via the carrier, and to the place specified on the face of the applicable PO. Apple reserves the right to return, shipping charges collect, all Goods received in advance of the delivery schedule. If no delivery schedule is specified, the order shall be filled promptly and delivery will be made by the most expeditious form of transportation by land or sea. If no carrier is specified in the PO, Seller shall use the least expensive carrier. In the event Seller fails to deliver the Goods within the time specified, Apple may, at its option, decline to accept the Goods and cancel the PO without liability or may demand its allocable fair share of Seller's available Goods and cancel the balance of the PO without liability. Seller shall package all items in suitable containers to permit safe transportation and handling. Each delivered container must be labeled and marked to identify contents without opening and all boxes and packages\n"
